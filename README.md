## How to Use:
First select which way to convert, Steam-to-Epic Games or Epic Games-to-Steam.
Then simply drag and drop files or folders* into the program window and the converted files will be created in the same directory and will be prefixed with "EG_" for Steam-to-Epic and "Steam_" for Epic-to-Steam, you can also specifiy a specific path to a file or folder in the text box.
